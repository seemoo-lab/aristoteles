## Unreleased

### Features

- Add Direction Header to most of the packets

### Fixes

- Fix usage of deprecated Frida functions in watch_frida.py

## [v2.1.0](https://github.com/seemoo-lab/aristoteles/tree/v2.1.0) (13-03-2025)

### Features

- Added TLV parser for `IBILteCellInfoT`
- Added the new ARI structures from iOS 18.3.1

### Changes

- tools: Made asString extractor more fail-safe when resolving pointers

## [v2.0.0](https://github.com/seemoo-lab/aristoteles/tree/v2.0.0) (28-11-2021)

### Features

- Added a GMID field to the dissector (virtual field, combination of group + type id) by @sterzy (#6)
- Add Acknowledgement Option field by @sterzy (#2)
- Added TLV codec's byte length extraction via the structure extraction Ghidra script
- AsString codec resolver can now also resolve lists of enums, thanks to the codec length extraction

### Changes

- Renamed Type and Type Name fields to Message ID and Message Name, to match their names inside `libARI.dylib`
  - Those were also renamed in `libari`, but all are backwards compatible and still accessible via `packet.type`
  - BREAKING: Existing Wireshark filters and the field identifiers, because they have also changed
  - The argument to modify the type for the `inject_custom_packet.py` script was also changed from `--type` to `--mid`
    - The `--type` argument is still available for backwards compatibility
- Added short identifiers for various fields like "gid" for the group or "mid" for the message ID to match log output and identifiers found in `libARI.dylib`
- Renamed `utils.lua` to `ari_utils.lua` to prevent interference with other lua plugins
- Added subtrees "Extra Information" and "Unknown Bits" to TLV tree to clear up the overview
- Mark GMID and type name fields as generated, to show that they are virtual fields

### Fixes

- Remove unknown bit 7 in byte 5 (is part of the group id) by @sterzy (#4)
- Fix range of bytes shown to include parts of the group id (#8)
- Fix range of bytes shown for structural tree elements like "Header", "Data" etc.

### Removals

- Removed TLV "Starts at" field

## [v1.0.0](https://github.com/seemoo-lab/aristoteles/tree/v1.0.0) (11-08-2021)
